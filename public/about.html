<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>37  years old male, learning to code for the first time as he believes is a great opportunity to keep growing career wise.
  Currently, I work as a Marketing Automation and Analytics manager and I work on a daily basis with a Platform called Marketo,
  which is the main reason why I'm beggining to code, since Marketo allows to build LP's, emails and API's using HTML, CSS & javascript.
</p>

<p>I have a master's degree in senior management and I look forward to keep learning more and growing both, as person and as a proffesional.</p>

<p>Part of my hobbies are, videogames, movies, anime boardgames, football (the real one, the one where they actually kick the ball.).</p>
